## Realtime Mosaic 
1. Implemented an efficient and easy to use software tool to mask people's face from camera video streams using OpenCV and C++ in Visual Studio 2017.
2. The program allows user to select a target region via mouse button-down, dragging, and button up operations. The mosaic effect is generated permanently based on the user's selected rectangle region.
